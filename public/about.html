<p>Software developers design, create, and maintain software for applications and systems. There are two main types of software developers: application developers and systems software developers.Application software focuses on mobile or web applications for consumers, while systems software developers create enterprise system solutions. Both types of developers analyze, test, and improve software to better meet user needs. They oversee the entire software lifecycle, including designing individual parts, performing maintenance, and deploying upgrades.Developers work closely with other IT professionals, such as programmers and quality assurance analysts. They also share many responsibilities with software engineers. However, software engineers take a broader approach and apply engineering principles to the entire system. Software developers focus more on finding specific solutions to users' software needs.Software developers typically work in the computer systems design industry. Other common employers include financial and insurance institutions, software publishers, and manufacturers.</p>


<p>A job description for a software developer includes researching, designing, building, and managing computer and application software. They apply scientific and technological principles to user needs, write code, and ensure software functionality. These developers must know coding languages, have problem-solving and critical-thinking skills, and understand the software development process. Software developers collaborate with coders, computer programmers, software engineers, and other team members or work independently through the development process. They test software, make changes as needed, and document their efforts. Application developers create mobile and desktop applications, while systems software engineers focus on operating systems. Game software developers, security software developers, database developers, and web developers are among the other specializations in the field.</p>


<p>According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), software developers earn a median salary of $132,270 as of May 2023, far outpacing the national median salary of $48,060 for all occupations. For comparison, the BLS reports that the median income for all computer occupations is $104,420. However, a software developer's salary depends on factors like industry, geographic location, and professional experience. About 25% of software developers work in the computer systems design industry, and the top-paying industries for software developers include information services, computer equipment manufacturing, and independent artists and performers. The best states for software developers, in terms of salary, include California, Washington, and Maryland.</p>
